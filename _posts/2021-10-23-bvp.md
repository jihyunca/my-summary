## Bessemer Venture Partners Fellowship

In 2020, I was part of the Bessemer Venture Partners Fellowship. The BVP fellowship appoints 20 students interested in Product Design, Product Mangement, Engineering, and Data Science in order to work with companies under the BVP portfolio.   

Through this experience, I was able to meet some of the best mentors, get amazing insight through workshops, and be a part of a great cohort.

In addition, thanks to the BVP program, I was able to match with a very cool startup which is also part of the BVP portfolio. I was able to work with Tribe, a customizable community platform.
