## Bessemer Venture Partners Fellowship

In 2020, I was part of the Bessemer Venture Partners Fellowship. 

Through this experience, I was able to meet some of the best mentors, get amazing insight through workshops, and be a part of a great cohort.

Through the BVP program, I was able to match with a very cool startup which is also part of the BVP portfolio. I was able to work with Tribe, a customizable community platform.
