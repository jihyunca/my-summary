## Bessemer Venture Partners Fellowship

In 2020, I was part of the Bessemer Venture Partners Fellowship. The BVP fellowship appoints 20 students interested in Product Design, Product Mangement, Engineering, and Data Science in order to work with companies under the BVP portfolio.   

Through this experience, I was able to meet some of the best mentors, get amazing insight through workshops, and be a part of a great cohort. Personally, I thought the mentorship was one of the best parts of the program. The initial call started with introducing myself and learning more about my mentor and their career path. However, the conversations became more personal and impactful; I could share so many challenges that I was going through that my mentor had already faced before. My mentor understood me better than anyone else, and was able to give me advice and empathy like no-one else. 

In addition, thanks to the BVP program, I was able to match with a very cool startup which is also part of the BVP portfolio. I was able to work with Tribe, a customizable community platform.
