# Square Code Camp

In 2019, I had the amazing opportunity to be a part of the Square Code Camp hosted by Square for girls in North America. Square hosts a 5-day immersion program in order to inspire more women to learn about technology and make an impact on the industry. The program is great, consisting of many workshops, networking sessions, and seminars for students.

In 2019, I was in second year. I had just finished first year, and felt a little bit insecure. University was more of a challenge than I had expected, and I did not feel that I was performing well. I was almost at a point where I was doubting that Computer Science was the right path for me. 

However, through the Square Code Camp, I was able to redeem some of my best qualities that I had forgotten about: curiosity and perseverance. 

We were able to try out a handful of workshops, including iOS development, Ruby on Rails development, and design brainstorming sessions. One of the most fun events were a mini hackathon they hosted amongst the participants. My group and I decided to utilize the workshop that we had learnt from and try out Ruby on Rails to create a web application. We wanted to make a product that could make an impact on society -- therefore, we created an application that could help others pay it forward. Through the application, users can find shops and stores that help pay it forward. Those who want to donate can purchase from those places, and those who are in need can go to the shops to get necessities. 

After presenting our application to a crowd of judges (including the participants and even other engineers from Square), we were awarded first place! It was a very exciting experience. 

Although all of the technical workshops were refreshing, the girls I met at Square Code Camp were unforgettable. Being constantly surrounded by male students at school made me forget how comforting it was to be around other girls who I could relate to. We shared stories with each other about our challenges in the industry, and gave each other support. Even to this day, they give me the support and help that keeps me going. 

Overall, my experience at Square Code Camp was almost life-changing; it reminded me of why I wanted to pursue a career in Computer Science. It also helped me build so many strong friendships that encouraged me to become a better person and a better engineer.
