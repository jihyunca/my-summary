# Square Code Camp

In 2019, I had the amazing opportunity to be a part of the Square Code Camp hosted by Square for girls in North America. 

In 2019, I was in second year. I had just finished first year, and felt a little bit insecure. University was more of a challenge than I had expected, and I did not feel that I was performing well. I was almost at a point where I was doubting that Computer Science was the right path for me. 

Through the Square Code Camp, I was able to redeem some of my best qualities that I had forgotten about: curiosity and perseverance.
