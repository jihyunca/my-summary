## Hackathons

One of the most impactful events that have jumpstarted my career and my passion for Computer Science was hackathons.

Here's a list of some hackathons I've been to:

-Hack the North

-Hack the 6ix

-Hack Western

-RUHacks

-PennApps


### Why hackathons?

It is non-committal, fun, and impactful. Hackathons usually last around 1-2 days, which means a weekend of hacking. Sometimes, side projects can be a drag because they can take a long time, or if we schedule any more than 2 months, we tend to forget what we were working on. The short period of time that is offered to create a project is exciting and manageable.

### What did I get out of hackathons?

#### Quickthinking

As I have highlighted multiple times, the event is short. Therefore, there is not a lot of time to plan, build, and present. Often, things will not go as you expect. Therefore, you must think quick in order to change directions, whether it be choosing a new idea, changing the language you are using, or change some of the features.

In addition, when you do a final presentation for the judges, your demo may not go as planned! Quick-thinking may consist of explaining where your demo is lacking, trying to find an alternative way to make your product work, or communicate verablly to get your message across.

#### Insight into new technology

As you are to build a new project in around 48 hours around the theme that the event gives you, you are given endless opportunities. 

Especially with the many sponsors and mentors available at the hackathon, you can use them to your advantage. Many of them are excited to introduce their own technology and product to you, which gives you a chance to learn about something new. In addition, many hackathons offer tutorials and workshops where the hosts may explain a new topic to you. This type of session is valuable because you can get a chance to directly interact with tools that you may not be familiar with. You might even spark some kind of new interest in something you may not have expected!

For instance, I am no Machine Learning expert in any way. However, some of my teammates had some experience with using Keras and Tensorflow. We decided to use this for our project as a challenge; a lot of us wanted to learn something new. By seeking out mentors who also had experience in this beforehand, we were able to learn quickly and immensely about the topic. Of course it was difficult, but it was rewarding at the same time.


#### Friendship

Some of the closest friends I have made in the field of technology are from hackathons. Now, I don't mean to say that every person you meet at the event will be your soulmate. Sometimes, you will even end up teaming up with people you already know, which prevents you from meeting others. 

However, the individuals I have met at the events were very similar-minded, passionate, and open. As they come with a similar purpose as you, they are willing to talk to you and build a friendship with you. You would have more in common with them than you would have first assumed. 

These friendships go a long way because people will go off to do different things, but often, in the same field.
