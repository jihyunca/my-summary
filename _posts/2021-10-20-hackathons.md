## Hackathons

One of the most impactful events that have jumpstarted my career and my passion for Computer Science was hackathons.

Here's a list of some hackathons I've been to:

-Hack the North
-Hack the 6ix
-Hack Western
-RUHacks
-PennApps


### Why hackathons?

It is non-committal, fun, and impactful. Hackathons usually last around 1-2 days, which means a weekend of hacking. Sometimes, side projects can be a drag because they can take a long time, or if we schedule any more than 2 months, we tend to forget what we were working on. The short period of time that is offered to create a project is exciting and manageable.

### What did I get out of hackathons?

#### Quickthinking

As I have highlighted multiple times, the event is short. Therefore, there is not a lot of time to plan, build, and present. Often, things will not go as you expet. 

#### Insight into new technology

As you are to build a new project in around 48 hours around the theme that the event gives you, you are given endless opportunities. 


#### Friendship

Some of the closest friends I have made in the field of technology are from hackathons. Now, I don't mean to say that every person you meet at the event will be your soulmate. Sometimes, you will even end up teaming up with people you already know, which prevents you from meeting others. 

However, the individuals I have met at the events were very similar-minded, passionate, and open. As they come with a similar purpose as you, they are willing to talk to you and build a friendship with you. You would have more in common with them than you would have first assumed. 

These friendships go a long way because people will go off to do different things, but often, in the same field.
