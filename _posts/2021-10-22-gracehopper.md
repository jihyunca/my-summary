# Grace Hopper Conference

I was able to be a part of the 2019, 2020, and 2021 Grace Hopper Conference.

At Grace Hopper, initially, I found the conference really daunting. The conference was large; there were crowds of participants. However, I quickly learned that many of the participants there displayed empathy, passion, and compassion. Any interaction led to a great conversation, where I was able to learn about their own story and be inspired by their journey. As a young aspiring engineer, I was able to receive advice that I would have never been able to come across before. 

I was invited to events where I could privately meet engineers.
