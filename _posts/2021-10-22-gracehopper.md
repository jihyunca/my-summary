# Grace Hopper Conference

I was able to be a part of the 2019, 2020, and 2021 Grace Hopper Conference.

At Grace Hopper, initially, I found the conference really daunting. However, I quickly learned that many of the participants there displayed empathy, passion, and compassion.

I was invited to events where I could privately meet engineers.
